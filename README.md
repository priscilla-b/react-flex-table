# React Flex Table

A modern, flexible, and performant data table built with **React**, **Vite**, **TailwindCSS**, and **TanStack Table**.  
It supports large datasets, inline editing, saved views, filter builder, bulk actions, and a lightweight **Express + SQLite** backend.

## üöÄ Features
- **Dynamic tables** ‚Äì Resize, reorder, hide, and show columns to fit your workflow without losing track of data.  
- **Large dataset handling** ‚Äì Virtual scrolling keeps the interface smooth and responsive, even with thousands of records.  
- **Inline editing** ‚Äì Update records directly in the table. Inputs adapt to the data type (text, notes, numbers, dates, dropdowns), so editing feels natural.  
- **Saved views** ‚Äì Store table setups (filters, sorting, visible columns, pagination) and switch between them as needed. Great for recurring workflows.  
- **Advanced filters** ‚Äì Build flexible conditions with AND/OR logic, allowing both quick searches and complex queries.  
- **Bulk actions** ‚Äì Edit, duplicate, or delete multiple records at once, with clear confirmation and feedback.  
- **User feedback** ‚Äì Newly added rows are highlighted for context, and toast notifications confirm actions like saves, edits, or deletes.  
- **Accessible & responsive UI** ‚Äì Keyboard shortcuts (Enter, Escape) for editing, sticky headers, hover/focus indicators, and a layout that works across screen sizes.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js **18+**

### Install
```bash
# Frontend
npm install

# Backend
cd server
npm install
```

### Run
```bash
# Backend
cd server
npm run dev      # http://localhost:5174

# Frontend (in another terminal)
cd ../
npm run dev      # http://localhost:5173
```

> The SQLite database files (`flex-table.db`, `-wal`, `-shm`) live in `/server`.

## üß© Design & Architecture

### Frontend

- **Composable table core**. Built from small, predictable pieces (columns, rows, cells, header, toolbar) so it‚Äôs easy to extend with behaviors like resizing, reordering, and visibility toggles.
- **Scales to large datasets**. Uses virtualization to render only what‚Äôs visible, keeping the DOM light and interactions smooth even with tens of thousands of records.
- **Inline, context-aware editing**. Cells adapt to their data type (text, notes, select lists, numbers, dates). Text inputs auto-grow; updates are saved with debouncing or immediately where appropriate, with rollbacks on error.
- **Portable "views"**. Users can save and recall table configurations‚Äîfilters, sorting, visible columns, and page size. The UI highlights when the current setup differs from a saved view.
- **Flexible filtering**. Quick per-column search and an advanced filter builder (with AND/OR logic) for more complex queries.
- **Intuitive UX details**. Sticky headers, clear hover/focus states, keyboard shortcuts (Enter/Escape), toast notifications for bulk actions, and row highlighting after creation help users stay oriented and confident.

### Backend
- A lightweight **Express + SQLite** API powers persistence.  
- Provides CRUD endpoints for leads and saved views.  
- Ships with mock data for leads, so the app is usable right away.  
- Enables persistence of saved views so they survive page reloads, instead of living only in memory.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations & Trade-offs

- The backend is minimal ‚Äî designed for demo purposes, not production use. 
- No authentication ‚Äî all users share the same dataset and views in this demo setup. 
- Filtering and sorting logic is simple; complex scenarios (e.g. nested conditions, fuzzy text search) would need more robust handling.   
- Only light client validation checks; minimal server validation.
- SQLite makes it easy to run locally, but isn‚Äôt a scalable solution for multi-user deployments. 
- Mobile-responsiveness limited for some features

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Improvements
- Role-based auth; per-user/team view sharing
- Support for exporting data (CSV, Excel, PDF). 
- Column-level validation and error feedback.  
- Replace SQLite with Postgres/MySQL for multi-user scaling.
- Audit log for edits; undo/redo
